# Todo's

- [ ] read this mf https://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/
- [ ] opening javascript and html ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®
- [ ] hot-loading new file
- [ ] default-video is the last one played

ok so general idea now is not to listen to any keys from this application but rather interact with the application directly 
with the use of another application, because of how Window Managers are made differently it's almost impossible to handle it 
properly without using infinite ammounts of ifdefs xinfo == i3 blablabla.

I somehow managed to spawn a 800x600 window on i3 that is locked and won't ever go away XDDD.
